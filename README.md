# Jan2018
Background material for the January 2018 meetup

Here's some great background papers for the January meetup: 

[An Introduction to Quantum Computing, Without the Physics, 2017,  Nannicini](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03684)

[An Introduction to Quantum Algorithms, 2011, Strubell](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~strubell/doc/quantum_tutorial.pdf)

I highly recommend getting an account for [IBM's Quantum Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience) and running through the tutorials. 

I found [Craig Gidney's blog and tools](http://algassert.com) to be useful in visualizing QC. 

There's a large number of [Quantum Simulators that can be found here](https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/list-qc-simulators). 

You really need a excellent grasp on linear algebrea to understand quantum computing. [Here's a good place to start.](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1522001/files/978-1-4614-6336-8_BookBackMatter.pdf)
